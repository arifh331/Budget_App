# **Budget\_App**

Budget\_App is a simple Web-Application that allows the user to _budget_ their income and expenses for a particular year and visualize in an-easy-to-understand set of tables of incomes and expenses. The application uses this information to calculate the budget for that particular year.

# **Motivation**

The purpose of this application is simply to see how I can use fundamental JavaScript concepts towards a practical application that can be easy to use and can also be very useful if taken even further!

# **How To Use**

After downloading the folder, to get the application running simply open the HTML document with your web-browser(I used Google Chrome!).

On the _description_ bar, you type in the definition or the description of the expense or income you are entering.

The _value_ bar to the right of it, is where you enter the numerical value of the expense or income that you just listed.

To the left of the description bar is the option to decide if the entry is an expense(minus sign) or an income(plus sign).

Then either click on the checkmark or press &quot;enter&quot; to add the entry into the respective income or expense table.

The left table is the income table which lists all the incomes while right table lists all the expenses

If you hover over the entry on the table, you can click the X that becomes visibles if you wish to delete that entry.

The top of the page has a blue bar that holds the value of your total income that you have entered.

Below it, is the red bar that has the total expenses you entered.

Above both of these bars is the Budget Calculation that shows how much your Income outweighs your expenses or vice-versa.

Give it a try! There are obviously other features that can be added but I think this is a good starting point for a budget application!
